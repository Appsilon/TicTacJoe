# TicTacJoe
This repo holds a demo app with TicTacJoe - a reinforcement learning example for the game of Tic Tac Toe

# TODO
- "End game" button should close modal with game
- Let user choose who starts (now it is random)
- Fix UpdateButton so that it uses the update_action_button as well
- Make training update state of TTJ
- Run game - alternating and storing progress
- Display probabilities of a move
- Display saturation for a given move (?)
- Rearrange UI nicely

# TicTacJoe
This repo holds an app with TicTacJoe - a reinforcement learning example for the game of Tic Tac Toe.

Interestingly, the reinforcement learning back-end is implemented in pure R - with no libraries used.

The first version of the code for the game (with some very basic UI - can be found in the x11_version folder), was developed at Itility, by Donald van den Hoogenband and Jędrzej Świeżewski.

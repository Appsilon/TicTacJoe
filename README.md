# TicTacJoe
This repo holds a demo app with TicTacJoe - a reinforcement learning example for the game of Tic Tac Toe.

The first version of the code for the game (with some very basic UI), was developed at Itility, by Donald van den Hoogenband and Jędrzej Świeżewski.

# TODO
- **DONE** "End game" button should close modal with game
- **DONE** Let user choose who starts (now it is random)
- **DONE** Fix UpdateButton so that it uses the update_action_button as well
- **DONE** Make training update state of TTJ
- **DONE** Add flushing training,
- **DONE** Enable/disable training and flushing
- Prevent the disabled moves from greying out (modify UpdateButton)
- Run game - alternating and storing progress
- Display probabilities of a move
- **DONE** Display saturation for a given move (?)
- Rearrange UI nicely
- Reset the state of the game board when the modal with it is closed
- prevent the "first" button to be "hovered-on" when loading a page (main and the game as well)
